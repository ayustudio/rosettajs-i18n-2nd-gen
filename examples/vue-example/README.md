# RosettaJS-i18n Vue Example

This project demonstrates how to use RosettaJS-i18n in a Vue 3 application.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
npm install


2. Start the development server:
npm run serve


3. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app in your browser.

## Features Demonstrated

- Basic translation
- Pluralization
- Number formatting
- Language switching
- Use of Vue 3 Composition API
- Integration with Vue 3's provide/inject for global i18n instance

## Project Structure

- `src/App.vue`: Main application component
- `src/components/LanguageSwitcher.vue`: Component for switching languages
- `src/components/ShoppingCart.vue`: Component demonstrating translations
- `src/main.js`: Entry point of the application

## Notes

This example uses Vue CLI for simplicity. In a real-world application, you might want to use a more customized setup.

Remember to properly handle language preferences, possibly storing them in local storage or syncing with a backend service.
