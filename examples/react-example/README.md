# RosettaJS-i18n React Example

This project demonstrates how to use RosettaJS-i18n in a React application.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
npm install


2. Start the development server:
npm start


3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

## Features Demonstrated

- Basic translation
- Pluralization
- Number formatting
- Language switching
- Use of React context for providing the translator
- Use of custom hooks for accessing translations

## Project Structure

- `src/App.tsx`: Main application component
- `src/index.tsx`: Entry point of the application

## Notes

This example uses Create React App for simplicity. In a real-world application, you might want to use a more customized setup.

Remember to properly handle language preferences, possibly storing them in local storage or syncing with a backend service.
