# RosettaJS-i18n Preact Example

This project demonstrates how to use RosettaJS-i18n in a Preact application.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the app in your browser.

## Features Demonstrated

- Basic translation
- Pluralization
- Number formatting
- Language switching
- Use of Preact context for providing the translator
- Use of custom hooks for accessing translations

## Project Structure

- `src/app.tsx`: Main application component
- `src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx`: Component for switching languages
- `src/components/ShoppingCart.tsx`: Component demonstrating translations
- `src/index.tsx`: Entry point of the application

## Notes

This example uses Preact CLI for simplicity. In a real-world application, you might want to use a more customized setup.

Remember to properly handle language preferences, possibly storing them in local storage or syncing with a backend service.
